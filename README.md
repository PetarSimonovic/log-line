<h1> Log Line </h1>

A log line is a concise summary of a story that provides an overview of the central characters, concepts and conflicts.

A good log line should hook the reader in. It needs to be short enough to be pitched to someone in an elevator yet contain a sense of the central characters, concepts and conflicts.
